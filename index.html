  <h1>Relativity paradox</h1>
<p><strong><em>May 14th, 2019</em> by Aziz Lokhandwala</strong></p>
<h2>Abstract: You have probably heard of twin paradox from Einstein in which two twin brother, one on platform and other in train which is going at speed of light. Let's modify this twin paradox:</h2>

<p>Let's assume two brother Aziz and Aziz'. Now Aziz ' goes to railway station to say bye to his brother Aziz on his skateboard. Now, Aziz sits in a train moving at speed of light and Aziz' is on his skateboard which is as slow as nothing but <em>"he is not stationary"</em>. Now let's assume surrounding as one frame and system as second frame. Now, Aziz who is in train which is moving at speed of light thus for him time slows down with respect to system. Now, Aziz' is as slow as nothing but not stationary so for him surrounding is moving at speed of light with respect to him and with respect to system he is stationary. So here the paradox arises as follows:</p>
<p><strong>"As for both of them surrounding is moving at speed of light, thus Aziz and Aziz' will have same time properties with respect to surrrounding. Thus, for both of them time is same. Thus if you go as fast as nothing or you go as slow as nothing, time with respect to surrounding defines same"</strong></p>
